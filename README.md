1. Use Existing Aozora Bunko Files as Training Data
    - We can find original texts since Aozora Bunko shows the original version of the texts ("Â∫ïÊú¨").

## This Project consists of...

1. Text Recognition
   - OCR with Python
   - Aim to generate texts accurately and quickly also in Japanese vertical texts
1. Viewer/Editor
   - Simple and Fast Viewer and Editor working on Browser
   - Anyone can modify the generated texts either in the Built-in Editor or GitHub (Can we compare the original pictures and the generated texts?)
   - Can this editor be built with Python as well?
1. Text Matching Game
   - Matching Game for Japanese Texts
   - Aim to improve the accuracy of OCR (also for fun, of course!)
   - This game can be a learning material for Japanese learners (like [the original concept of Duolingo](https://www.ted.com/talks/luis_von_ahn_massive_scale_online_collaboration))
   - cf. Google Captcha
